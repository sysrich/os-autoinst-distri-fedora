os-autoinst test cases for Fedora

This is going to be an attempt to build a basic set of openQA test cases
for the Fedora linux distribution

This was started as a learning exercise to build an openQA distribution
test suite from scratch, but hopefully will be picked up and extended to
be a comprehensive test suite for Fedora the same way 
os-autoinst-distri-opensuse tests openSUSE and SLE

For more information please contact Richard Brown via email at
